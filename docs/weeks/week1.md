# Week 1 Communication / UX

## What were you tasked to do (Comm/UX)

1. Identify a website with poor UX and communication.
2. Use the selected website throughout the course to document my design and analysis process.

## How did you do it / Which website you chose

- I reviewed X-ray–related websites with weak UX and communication.
- I considered three options:
  - [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.com)
  - [West Vancouver Rec Center](https://westvancouver.ca/parks-recreation/facilities/west-vancouver-community-centre-aquatic-centre)
  - [Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.](https://www.pnwx.com/)
- After evaluation and discussion using ChatGPT, I selected **Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.**

### Why did I choose this website?

1. The design feels visually cluttered, with excessive colors and inconsistent styling.
2. The frequent use of yellow underlined links reduces emphasis on the most important content.
3. Many links compete for attention; I would reduce and condense them into fewer, higher-priority options to improve readability and user interaction.

### Are you working alone or in a team? Why?

- I am working alone to maintain focus and strengthen my critical and analytical thinking.

### What are you hoping to get out of this class?

1. Understand the UX documentation and design process, including work done in Figma.
2. Improve my writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills.
3. Redesign the website over the summer and propose it to the owners or include it in my portfolio.
