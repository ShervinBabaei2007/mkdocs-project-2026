# Week 1: Communication & UX

## 1. Task Overview

For this course, I was asked to identify a website with poor user experience and communication, then use it throughout the term to document my design and analysis process.

## 2. Website Selection Process

I began by reviewing X-ray–related websites with weak UX and communication. After narrowing down my options to three candidates—[Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.com), the [West Vancouver Recreation Center](https://westvancouver.ca/parks-recreation/facilities/west-vancouver-community-centre-aquatic-centre), and [Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.](https://www.pnwx.com/)—I evaluated each through discussion and analysis using ChatGPT. Ultimately, I selected **Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.** as my focus.

## 3. Rationale for Selection

This website stood out for several UX issues. The design feels visually cluttered, with excessive colors and inconsistent styling that detract from the user experience. The frequent use of yellow underlined links reduces emphasis on the most important content, making it difficult for users to prioritize information. Additionally, many links compete for attention across the interface. I believe condensing these into fewer, higher-priority options would significantly improve readability and user interaction.

## 4. Working Approach

I am working alone on this project to maintain focus and strengthen my critical and analytical thinking skills.

## 5. Course Goals

Through this class, I'm hoping to gain a comprehensive understanding of the UX documentation and design process, including hands-on work in Figma. I also want to improve my writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills. Looking ahead, I plan to redesign the website over the summer and either propose it to the owners or include it in my portfolio as a case study.
