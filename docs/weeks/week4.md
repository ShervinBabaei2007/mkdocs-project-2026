# Reflection: Problem Definition, Ideation, and Information Architecture

This week focused on clearly defining the problem before moving into design or development. Instead of jumping straight to solutions, the work emphasized understanding users, their goals, and how information should be structured to support them effectively.

This process reinforced the idea that good design starts with understanding the problem, not making things look nice or adding extra features.

## Problem Statement & The Five Ws

Writing a problem statement helped me step back and focus on **what problem the website is actually trying to solve**. Using the Five Ws gave structure to my thinking and prevented vague assumptions.

- **Who**: Identifying the users highlighted that different users have different goals, levels of experience, and time constraints.
- **What**: Clarifying what the site offers helped define the main focus of the experience instead of trying to do everything at once.
- **Where**: Recognizing that the site is accessed online emphasized the need for accessibility across devices.
- **When**: Understanding that users often visit the site when they need information quickly reinforced the importance of efficiency.
- **Why**: Defining the reason for the redesign made it clear that the goal is to reduce confusion and improve usability, not just to refresh the look.

## Scope & Feature Definition

Defining the scope helped set realistic boundaries for the project. Listing what would and would not be implemented ensured that the focus stayed on **structure and clarity**, rather than advanced functionality or visuals.

This step made it easier to prioritize essential work and avoid feature creep.

## Ideation Process

The ideation phase encouraged generating ideas without judgment. Techniques such as brainstorming, worst possible ideas, and Crazy 8s helped expand my thinking and explore a wide range of possibilities.

Brainstorming allowed me to consider multiple approaches to organizing content and navigation. This helped surface different ways users might move through the site and access information.

The worst possible idea technique was useful for identifying common usability mistakes. By intentionally thinking about bad design choices, it became easier to recognize what should be avoided in the final structure.

Crazy 8s pushed me to think quickly and sketch multiple wireframe layout ideas without overthinking details. This rapid process encouraged creativity and prevented me from fixating on a single solution too early.

Overall, this phase emphasized generating a high quantity of ideas rather than focusing on quality upfront, which made later decision-making more efficient and informed.

## Information Architecture (IA)

Information Architecture tied everything together by focusing on how users find information.

- Navigation hierarchy helped balance between deep and shallow structures.
- Labelling required using language that makes sense to users rather than internal terminology.
- Creating a content inventory and sitemap clarified how all pages relate to each other.
- Wireframes helped visualize structure without being distracted by styling.

This step showed how organization directly affects usability.

## What I Learned

This week taught me the importance of **problem-first thinking**. By clearly defining users, goals, and structure early on, future design and development decisions become easier to justify and more user-focused.

Instead of asking *“What features should this site have?”*, I am now asking:

- *“What is the user trying to do?”*
- *“What information do they need right now?”*
- *“What would slow them down or confuse them?”*

This mindset will guide my future wireframes, layouts, and overall design decisions.
