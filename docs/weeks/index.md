# Welcome

I'm Shervin Babaei, and this is my documentation site for **ACIT 2811** coursework. Here, I reflect on key concepts in UX design, usability, and web development through weekly learning journals.

## What You'll Find Here

This site documents my journey learning:

- Usability principles and heuristics
- Design thinking methodologies
- User research and testing approaches
- Web development best practices
- Real-world application of UX concepts

## Weekly Reflections

Each week, I explore different topics through hands-on projects and thoughtful analysis. Navigate to the [Reflections](/weeks/) section to see my learning progression.
