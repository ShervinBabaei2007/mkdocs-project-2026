# Week 3 Reflection

## 1. What I Worked on in ACIT 2811

This week focused on understanding users more deeply by creating **personas**, **user stories**, and **user scenarios**. Instead of guessing what users want, we had to clearly define who they are, what they need, and how they would realistically interact with the website.

This step helped slow me down and think before jumping into design solutions.

## 2. Personas

I created two primary personas to represent the main users of the Pacific Northwest X-Ray website.

**Dr. Sarah Martinez** represents experienced clinical decision-makers who need detailed product information, compliance documentation, and efficient reordering for multiple locations. She values accuracy, reliability, and time-saving tools.

**Mike Chen** represents non-technical practice managers who focus on speed, clarity, and budget control. He needs plain-language descriptions, transparent pricing, and a mobile-friendly experience.

Creating these personas helped me design for **real people with different goals**, rather than a generic “user.”

## 3. User Stories

User stories helped translate each persona’s needs into clear goals. Writing them in the “As a user, I want…” format made it easier to stay focused on outcomes instead of features.

For example:

- Dr. Sarah needs downloadable spec sheets and product comparisons to support compliance and purchasing decisions.
- Mike needs simple descriptions, visible pricing, and mobile ordering so he can work quickly without technical knowledge.

These stories clarified *why* certain features matter and helped prioritize what the redesigned website should support first.

## 4. User Scenarios

User scenarios allowed me to walk through realistic tasks step by step, such as:

- Downloading product specification sheets
- Comparing similar products
- Viewing transparent pricing and adding items to a cart

Mapping these flows showed where the current PNWX website creates friction and where a redesigned experience could remove unnecessary steps. It also helped me think about navigation, labeling, and content placement more intentionally.

## 5. What I Learned

This week reinforced how important it is to **design from the user’s perspective**, not my own. Personas, stories, and scenarios gave structure to my thinking and made design decisions easier to justify.

Instead of asking “What should the website include?”, I’m now asking:

- “What is the user trying to do?”
- “What information do they need right now?”
- “What would slow them down or confuse them?”

This shift will strongly guide my future & also current wireframes and design decisions.
