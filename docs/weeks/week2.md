# Week 2 Reflection

## What I Learned in ACIT 2811

### 1. Seven Usability Factors

So far, I have learned that the seven usability factors are an important part of designing a successful website or product. These factors strongly influence how users interact with a system and how they look at its overall quality.

In my opinion, the most important usability factors are **usable**, **findable**, **credible**, and **accessible**, because they directly affect whether users can complete tasks effectively.

If a website is not usable, users may become frustrated and leave. If content is not findable, users cannot complete their tasks even if the information exists. Credibility is important because users must trust the website, especially when sharing personal or payment information. Accessibility ensures that users with disabilities can also use the product, making the design more inclusive and ethical. Without these factors, even a visually appealing website can fail to meet user needs.

### 2. Design Thinking

Design thinking is a user-centered approach to solving both known and unknown problems. Although the concept can feel abstract at first, its main goal is to focus on understanding the user before jumping directly to a solution. (which I am not good at. I'm a bit of a jumpy person, but rarely I do the step-by-steps...)

The design thinking process consists of five stages:

- **Empathize:** Understanding the user and their needs through observation and feedback.
- **Define:** Clearly identifying the main problem that needs to be solved.
- **Ideate:** Brainstorming multiple ideas and possible solutions.
- **Prototype:** Creating a simple version of the solution to explore ideas.
- **Test:** Testing the prototype with users and using feedback to improve the design.

### 3. Term Project Proposal

We were asked to create a proposal for our term project that outlines what we plan to work on throughout the course. Chris will evaluate our progress based on what we include in the proposal, which closely resembles a real-world work environment in my opinion.

This process highlights the importance of setting realistic goals and being accountable for them, similar to how a manager or supervisor would evaluate performance in a professional setting.

### 4. Market Research

As part of my market research, I explored existing websites related to my project idea to understand current design approaches.

One example is [ProboMedical](https://www.probomedical.com/), which is similar to the website I plan to redesign. While the site appears modern, the image quality and some sections could be improved.

Another example is [GE Healthcare](https://shop.gehealthcare.ca/gehcstorefront/). Although it resembles my project concept, the layout and organization feel inconsistent, and the overall design lacks clarity and focus.
