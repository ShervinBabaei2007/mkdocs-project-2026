This project is written for **non-technical** users in the **medical imaging field**, including X-ray technicians, radiology staff, clinic managers, small healthcare providers, and buyers looking for X-ray equipment or parts.

The content and design decisions prioritize **_clarity, simplicity, and task completion_** rather than technical depth or internal business terminology. The goal is to help users quickly find products, understand information, and make confident decisions without feeling overwhelmed.
