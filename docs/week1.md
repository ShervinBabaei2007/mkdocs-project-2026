# Week 1 Communication/UX Class

## What were you tasked to do (Comm/UX)

1. I was tasked with finding a website that was poorly designed in terms of UX and communication.

2. I was required to use the chosen website throughout the UX course and document my full design and analysis process during the term.

## How did you do it / Which website you chose

- I searched for websites related to the field of X-ray  that showed weak UX and communication practices.

- I had 3 choices:
  - Craigslist [website](https://www.craigslist.com)
  - West Vancouver Rec Center [website](https://westvancouver.ca/parks-recreation/facilities/west-vancouver-community-centre-aquatic-centre)
  - Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. [website](https://www.pnwx.com/)

- After multiple discussions and evaluations using ChatGPT, I selected Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.

### Why did I choose this?

1. I choose this because It reminded me of somewhat myself in elementary, because as kids - we usually tend to make silly things and use same colors with different varieties.

2. Also the use of simple highlighted yellow underline reminds me of myself when I use to underline texts all the texts without focusing on the _**most important ones**_. For example, in this photo, I would personally choose to highlight **X-Ray Merchant Boards, X-Ray Grids, X-Ray Test Meters**.

3. The rest of them I would not consider worth highlighting/underlining, because there is just too much information. In addition to this I would cut half of them and condense them into 8 total links, for better readability and average user interaction.

### Are you working alone or in a team? Why?

- I am working alone because, I  thought it would be easier to focus on **1** thing that interests me.
- Also working with other people may have been easier for long term, however, I believe that working alone can boost my critical thinking and analytic thinking.

### What are you hoping to get out of this class(s)

1. Hoping to understand the whole process of why we are doing these documentations/building it on figma.

2. Strengthening my writing skill and also trying to Strengthening my thinking and analytic skills.

3. The most important one, I want to build the web page, during summer and propose it to the owners of the website, if that doesn't work, it will just go towards my portfolio.
