Website Selection Process","text":"<p>I began by reviewing X-ray\u2013related websites with weak UX and communication. After narrowing down my options to three candidates\u2014Craigslist, the West Vancouver Recreation Center, and Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.\u2014I evaluated each through discussion and analysis using ChatGPT. Ultimately, I selected Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. as my focus.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week1/#3-rationale-for-selection","title":"3. Rationale for Selection","text":"<p>This website stood out for several UX issues. The design feels visually cluttered, with excessive colors and inconsistent styling that detract from the user experience. The frequent use of yellow underlined links reduces emphasis on the most important content, making it difficult for users to prioritize information. Additionally, many links compete for attention across the interface. I believe condensing these into fewer, higher-priority options would significantly improve readability and user interaction.</p> <p></p> <p>Visit the website</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week1/#4-working-approach","title":"4.

Seven Usability Factors","text":"<p>The seven usability factors play a key role in designing effective websites and products. They strongly influence how users interact with a system and perceive its quality.</p> <p>The most important factors, in my view, are usable, findable, credible, and accessible, as they directly affect users\u2019 ability to complete tasks.</p> <p>If a site is not usable or content is hard to find, users become frustrated and leave. Credibility builds trust, especially when users share personal or payment information. Accessibility ensures inclusive and ethical design. Without these factors, even visually appealing websites can fail.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week2/#2-design-thinking","title":"2. Design Thinking","text":"<p>Design thinking is a user-centered approach focused on understanding users before proposing solutions. Although the process can feel abstract at first, it helps prevent jumping to conclusions without fully defining the problem.</p> <p>The design thinking process includes five stages:</p> <ul> <li>Empathize: Understand users through observation and feedback</li> <li>Define: Clearly identify the core problem</li> <li>Ideate: Generate multiple solution ideas</li> <li>Prototype: Create simple versions of solutions</li> <li>Test: Gather feedback to improve the design</li> </ul>"},{"location":"weeks/week2/#3-term-project-proposal","title":"3. Term Project Proposal","text":"<p>We were required to create a proposal outlining our goals for the term project. Progress will be evaluated against this proposal, reflecting real-world expectations of accountability and performance.</p> <p>This process emphasizes the importance of setting realistic goals and tracking progress, similar to professional project management.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week2/#4-market-research","title":"4. Market Research","text":"<p>As part of my market research, I reviewed existing websites related to my project to understand current design approaches.</p> <p>One example is ProboMedical. While the site appears modern, image quality and section consistency could be improved.</p> <p>Another example is GE Healthcare. Although similar in concept, the layout feels inconsistent and lacks clarity.</p> <p> Figure 1: ProboMedical homepage</p> <p> Figure 2: GE Healthcare Shop homepage</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week3/","title":"Week 3 What I Worked on in ACIT 2811","text":"<p>This week focused on understanding users more deeply by creating personas, user stories, and user scenarios. Instead of guessing what users want, we had to clearly define who they are, what they need, and how they would realistically interact with the website.</p> <p>This step helped slow me down and think before jumping into design solutions.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week3/#1-personas","title":"1. Personas","text":"<p>I created two primary personas to represent the main users of the Pacific Northwest X-Ray website.</p> <p>Dr. Sarah Martinez represents experienced clinical decision-makers who need detailed product information, compliance documentation, and efficient reordering for multiple locations. She values accuracy, reliability, and time-saving tools.</p> <p>Mike Chen represents non-technical practice managers who focus on speed, clarity, and budget control. He needs plain-language descriptions, transparent pricing, and a mobile-friendly experience.</p> <p>Creating these personas helped me design for real people with different goals, rather than a generic \u201cuser.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week3/#2-user-stories","title":"2. User Stories","text":"<p>User stories helped translate each persona\u2019s needs into clear goals. Writing them in the \u201cAs a user, I want\u2026\u201d format made it easier to stay focused on outcomes instead of features.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>Dr. Sarah needs downloadable spec sheets and product comparisons to support compliance and purchasing decisions.</li> <li>Mike needs simple descriptions, visible pricing, and mobile ordering so he can work quickly without technical knowledge.</li> </ul> <p>These stories clarified why certain features matter and helped prioritize what the redesigned website should support first.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week3/#3-user-scenarios","title":"3. User Scenarios","text":"<p>User scenarios allowed me to walk through realistic tasks step by step, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Downloading product specification sheets</li> <li>Comparing similar products</li> <li>Viewing transparent pricing and adding items to a cart</li> </ul> <p>Mapping these flows showed where the current PNWX website creates friction and where a redesigned experience could remove unnecessary steps. It also helped me think about navigation, labeling, and content placement more intentionally.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week3/#4-what-i-learned","title":"4. What I Learned","text":"<p>This week reinforced how important it is to design from the user\u2019s perspective, not my own. Personas, stories, and scenarios gave structure to my thinking and made design decisions easier to justify.</p> <p>Instead of asking \u201cWhat should the website include?\u201d, I\u2019m now asking:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cWhat is the user trying to do?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat information do they need right now?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat would slow them down or confuse them?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>This shift will strongly guide my future &amp; also current wireframes and design decisions.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week4/","title":"Reflection: Problem Definition, Ideation, and Information Architecture","text":"<p>This week focused on clearly defining the problem before moving into design or development. Instead of jumping straight to solutions, the work emphasized understanding users, their goals, and how information should be structured to support them effectively.</p> <p>This process reinforced the idea that good design starts with understanding the problem, not making things look nice or adding extra features.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week4/#1-problem-statement-the-five-ws","title":"1. Problem Statement &amp; The Five Ws","text":"<p>Writing a problem statement helped me step back and focus on what problem the website is actually trying to solve. Using the Five Ws gave structure to my thinking and prevented vague assumptions.</p> <ul> <li>Who: Identifying the users highlighted that different users have different goals, levels of experience, and time constraints.</li> <li>What: Clarifying what the site offers helped define the main focus of the experience instead of trying to do everything at once.</li> <li>Where: Recognizing that the site is accessed online emphasized the need for accessibility across devices.</li> <li>When: Understanding that users often visit the site when they need information quickly reinforced the importance of efficiency.</li> <li>Why: Defining the reason for the redesign made it clear that the goal is to reduce confusion and improve usability, not just to refresh the look.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"weeks/week4/#2-scope-feature-definition","title":"2. Scope &amp; Feature Definition","text":"<p>Defining the scope helped set realistic boundaries for the project. Listing what would and would not be implemented ensured that the focus stayed on structure and clarity, rather than advanced functionality or visuals.</p> <p>This step made it easier to prioritize essential work and avoid feature creep.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week4/#3-ideation-process","title":"3. Ideation Process","text":"<p>The ideation phase encouraged generating ideas without judgment. Techniques such as brainstorming, worst possible ideas, and Crazy 8s helped expand my thinking and explore a wide range of possibilities.</p> <p>Brainstorming allowed me to consider multiple approaches to organizing content and navigation. This helped surface different ways users might move through the site and access information.</p> <p>The worst possible idea technique was useful for identifying common usability mistakes. By intentionally thinking about bad design choices, it became easier to recognize what should be avoided in the final structure.</p> <p>Crazy 8s pushed me to think quickly and sketch multiple wireframe layout ideas without overthinking details. This rapid process encouraged creativity and prevented me from fixating on a single solution too early.</p> <p>Overall, this phase emphasized generating a high quantity of ideas rather than focusing on quality upfront, which made later decision-making more efficient and informed.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week4/#4-information-architecture-ia","title":"4. Information Architecture (IA)","text":"<p>Information Architecture tied everything together by focusing on how users find information.</p> <ul> <li>Navigation hierarchy helped balance between deep and shallow structures.</li> <li>Labelling required using language that makes sense to users rather than internal terminology.</li> <li>Creating a content inventory and sitemap clarified how all pages relate to each other.</li> <li>Wireframes helped visualize structure without being distracted by styling.</li> </ul> <p>This step showed how organization directly affects usability.</p>"},{"location":"weeks/week4/#5-what-i-learned","title":"5. What I Learned","text":"<p>This week taught me the importance of problem-first thinking. By clearly defining users, goals, and structure early on, future design and development decisions become easier to justify and more user-focused.</p> <p>Instead of asking \u201cWhat features should this site have?\u201d, I am now asking:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cWhat is the user trying to do?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat information do they need right now?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat would slow them down or confuse them?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>This mindset will guide my future wireframes, layouts, and overall design decisions.</p>"}]}
